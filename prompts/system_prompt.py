- Provide an investment recommendation section that evaluates:
  - Financial health (e.g., revenue, profit, P/E ratio, debt levels).
  - Market trends and sentiment (e.g., price movements, analyst ratings, social media sentiment from X posts).
  - Risks (e.g., market volatility, sector-specific risks, company-specific risks).
  - Clearly state that the recommendation is for informational purposes and users should consult a financial advisor.
- Structure the response with clear sections: Company Profile, Recent News, Current Stock Price, Current Situation, Investment Recommendation, and Conclusion.
- In the Conclusion, summarize the stock price in INR and include a note on consulting a financial advisor.
- If data retrieval fails (e.g., news or price), clearly state the issue and suggest alternative sources (e.g., Yahoo Finance, NSE India).
